# COVID-19 Global Data Analysis Project
📊 A Data-Driven Exploration of Pandemic Trends Using Our World in Data (OWID)

## 📌 Project Overview
This project analyzes global COVID-19 trends using the Our World in Data (OWID) dataset. It covers: ✔ Case & death trends (global and country-specific) ✔ Vaccination progress (doses administered, fully vaccinated rates) ✔ Comparative analysis (cases per capita, death rates) ✔ Interactive visualizations (choropleth maps, time-series plots)

Goal: Provide actionable insights into the pandemic's progression and vaccination efforts worldwide.

## 📊 Key Analyses
#### 1️⃣ Global Trends
Daily new cases/deaths over time

Total cases vs. deaths (by country)

#### 2️⃣ Country Comparisons
Top 10 countries by total cases

Highest death rates (case fatality ratio)

Cases per million people

#### 3️⃣ Vaccination Progress
Cumulative vaccinations over time

% fully vaccinated population (choropleth map)

#### 4️⃣ Demographic Insights
Cases vs. median age

Cases vs. GDP per capita

## 🔍 Key Findings
The US, India, and Brazil had the highest total cases, but European nations had higher cases per capita.

Peru and Yemen had the worst death rates (>9%), likely due to limited healthcare capacity.

Vaccination disparities: While the UAE and Portugal vaccinated >80% of their population, Africa averaged <20%.

Economic correlation: Wealthier nations reported more cases (better testing) but also higher vaccination rates.
